This project uses machine learning regression techniques to predict the price of a car based on key attributes like  mileage, age, and more. It is a real-world example of how machine learning can be applied to predict pricing in the automotive industry.

The goal is to build an accurate model that can estimate the car's market value, which can help buyers, sellers, and dealers make informed decisions.

Objectives :

1. Preprocess raw car dataset (cleaning, encoding, scaling).

2. Perform feature selection and engineering.

3. Train a regression model to predict car prices.

4. Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (RMSE, RÂ²).

5. Visualize relationships and model performance.
